## Overview
Vilicus is an open source tool that orchestrates security scans of container images(docker/oci) and centralizes all results into a database for further analysis and metrics. It can perform using Anchore[https://github.com/anchore/anchore-engine], Clair[https://github.com/quay/clair] and Trivy[https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy]

### How does it work?
There many tools to scan container images, but sometimes the results can be diferent in each one them. So the main goal of this project is to help development teams improve the quality of their container images by finding vulnerabilities and thus addressing them with anagnostic sight from vendors.

**Here you can find articles comparing the scanning tools**:

## Development
### Run deployment manually
```bash
docker-compose -f deployments/docker-compose.yaml up -d
```

---

## Usage

### Using vilicus client
Run these following commands:
```
export TEMPLATE=<template>
export OUTPUT=<output>
export IMAGE=<public_image>|<vilicus_local_image>
wget -O run-job.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edersonbrilhante/vilicus/develop/scripts/run-job.sh
chmod +x ./run-job.sh
./run-job.sh
```
The result will be stored in into the file set by the environment variable `OUTPUT`.

### Templates and Outputs
**Gitlab**<br>
***Template***: `/opt/vilicus/contrib/gitlab.tpl`<br>
***Output***: `/artifacts/gl-container-scanning-report.json`

**Sarif**<br>
***Template***: `/opt/vilicus/contrib/sarif.tpl`<br>
***Output***: `/artifacts/result.sarif`

### Public image and Local images
Vilicus provides support images hosted in public repository and local builds. Public image is an image hosted in public repository such as DockerHub. To scan images in self-hosted registry or local build you must tag the image to the vilicus local registry.

**Self-hosted registry**
`docker tag <self-hosted-registry>/<image:tag> localhost:5000/<image:tag>`

**Local build**
`docker build -t localhost:5000/<image:tag> -f <Dockerfile> <context>`
